# Pinax Starter Projects and Apps

## Code Reuse

For more information, see the Django docs [Reusability Matters section](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/reusable-apps/#reusability-matters).

## Common Website Patterns

Pinax starter projects and apps are reusable packages that can be used to bootstrap the most common types of websites. You only need to write the parts that make your project unique. Here are a few examples:

* prototype
* waitinglist
* blog
* marketplace
* social network
* conference website
* learning management system
* and more!
