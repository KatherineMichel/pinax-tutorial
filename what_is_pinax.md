# What is Pinax?

## The Pinax Ecosystem

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and templates for building websites.

Pinax code can be found in the [Pinax GitHub organization](https://github.com/pinax) account, where Pinax development takes place. 

### Pinax Starter Projects

Pinax Starter Projects are Django projects that can be found in the [Pinax Starter Projects](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-starter-projects) repo. Pinax Starter Projects can be used to bootstrap the most common types of websites. You only need to write the parts that make your project unique.

Here are a few examples:
* prototype
* waitinglist
* blog
* marketplace
* social network
* conference website
* learning management system
* and more!

### Pinax Apps

### Pinax CLI

[pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli) is a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to install Pinax Starter Projects.

### Pinax Templates

[pinax-templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates) are semantic templates made for use with Pinax.

## Pinax Packages

Pinax starter projects and apps are reusable packages. The Pinax starter project is a Django project framework that can be installed using the Pinax CLI (Command Line Tool). The self-contained Pinax apps that come pre-installed as packages provide the functionality needed for the project.

## Ways to Use Pinax

Because Pinax is made with the open-source programming language Python and web development framework Django, Pinax is fully-customizable. 

Here are some ways that you might use Pinax:
* A Pinax starter project as is, with small customizations
* A Pinax starter project with additional Pinax or third-party apps added
* A non-Pinax Django project with Pinax app(s) added
