# How Pinax Works

## Code Reuse

Computers were created to help people save time. It takes a lot of time and work to create a web application. When developers write code that solves a problem, they often package and publish the code in a public package index so that other developers can reuse the code in their own projects. This saves other developers who have the same problem from having to repeat the same work. In the Python and Django communities, developers publish their packages to [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org). 

## Pinax Packages

Pinax starter projects and apps are reusable packages. The Pinax starter project is a Django project framework that can be installed using the Pinax CLI (Command Line Tool). The self-contained Pinax apps that come pre-installed as packages provide the functionality needed for the project.

For more information about Django and code reusability, see the Django docs [Reusability Matters section](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/reusable-apps/#reusability-matters).
