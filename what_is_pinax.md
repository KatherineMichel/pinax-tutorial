# What is Pinax?

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and themes for building websites.

## Ways to Use Pinax

Because Pinax is made with the open-source programming language Python and web development framework Django, Pinax is fully-customizable. 

Here are some ways that you might use Pinax:
* A Pinax starter project as is, with small customizations
* A Pinax starter project with additional Pinax or third-party apps added
* A non-Pinax Django project with Pinax app(s) added
