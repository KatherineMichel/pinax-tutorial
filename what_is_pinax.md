# What is Pinax?

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and themes for building websites.

Pinax code can be found in the [Pinax GitHub organization](https://github.com/pinax) account, where Pinax development takes place. 

Pinax primarily consists of:
* Django starter projects contained in the branches of the [Pinax Starter Projects](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-starter-projects) repo
* [pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli), a command line interface that can be used to install these starter projects
* Django apps that provide a variety of functionality
* [pinax-templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates), a group of semantic templates made for use with Pinax

## Ways to Use Pinax

Because Pinax is made with the open-source programming language Python and web development framework Django, Pinax is fully-customizable. 

Here are some ways that you might use Pinax:
* A Pinax starter project as is, with small customizations
* A Pinax starter project with additional Pinax or third-party apps added
* A non-Pinax Django project with Pinax app(s) added
