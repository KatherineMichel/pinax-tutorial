# What is Pinax?

## The Pinax Ecosystem

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and themes for building websites.

Pinax code can be found in the [Pinax GitHub organization](https://github.com/pinax) account, where Pinax development takes place. 

Pinax primarily consists of:
* Pinax Starter Projects, found in the branches of the [Pinax Starter Projects](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-starter-projects) repo; Pinax Starter Projects are Django projects that follow common website patterns
* [pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli), a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to install these starter projects
* Django apps that provide a variety of functionality
* [pinax-templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates), a group of semantic templates made for use with Pinax

## Pinax Starter Projects and Common Website Patterns

Pinax starter projects and apps can be used to bootstrap the most common types of websites. You only need to write the parts that make your project unique. Here are a few examples:

* prototype
* waitinglist
* blog
* marketplace
* social network
* conference website
* learning management system
* and more!

## Ways to Use Pinax

Because Pinax is made with the open-source programming language Python and web development framework Django, Pinax is fully-customizable. 

Here are some ways that you might use Pinax:
* A Pinax starter project as is, with small customizations
* A Pinax starter project with additional Pinax or third-party apps added
* A non-Pinax Django project with Pinax app(s) added
