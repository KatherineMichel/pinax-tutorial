# What is Pinax?

Pinax is an open-source ecosystem of reusable Django starter projects, apps, and templates for building websites.

## Why Use Pinax?

It can take a lot of time and work to create a website from scratch. The code for a typical Django project might be created for one website and used one time only. 

Pinax starter projects, apps, and themes work differently than typical Django projects and apps, because they began as regular Django projects, were developed to provide specific functionality, then packaged to reuse and share. 

## The Pinax Ecosystem

The Pinax starter project provides a Django project framework that can be installed using the [pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli) (Command Line Tool). The stand-alone Pinax apps that come pre-installed as packages provide the functionality needed for the project.

### Pinax Starter Projects

Pinax starter projects can be found in the [pinax-starter-projects](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-starter-projects) repo. Pinax starter projects can be used to bootstrap the most common types of websites. You only need to write the parts that make your project unique.

Here are a few examples:
* prototype
* waitinglist
* blog
* marketplace
* social network
* conference website
* learning management system
* and more!

### Pinax Apps

Pinax apps are stand-alone Django apps that provide specific functionality. Pinax apps come pre-installed as packages in Pinax starter projects, or can be used independently.

### Pinax CLI

[pinax-cli](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-cli) is a command line interface (CLI) that can be used to install Pinax starter projects.

### Pinax Templates

[pinax-templates](https://github.com/pinax/pinax-templates) are semantic templates made for use with Pinax.

## Ways to Use Pinax

Because Pinax is made with the open-source programming language Python and web development framework Django, Pinax is fully-customizable. 

Here are some ways that you might use Pinax:
* A Pinax starter project as is, with small customizations
* A Pinax starter project with additional Pinax or third-party apps added
* A non-Pinax Django project with Pinax app(s) added
