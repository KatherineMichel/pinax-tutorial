# Basic App URLs and Templates

Pinax app templates are contained in the Pinax Templates package. If you are using a Pinax starter project, the Pinax Templates package will be automatically included in the project and installed in the project packages directory when you install the packages. If you are adding one of these apps into a non-Pinax project, you can install and use Pinax Templates, if you so choose.

App-level URLs vary greatly based on the app.
