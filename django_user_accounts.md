# Django User Accounts

## What is Django User Accounts?

Django User Accounts is a Pinax package used for account management. Django User Accounts extends (not replaces) Django's default user model. Django User Accounts extends the default user model because reusable apps won't work together if a custom user model is used in one of the apps.

Several Pinax starter projects include the Django User Accounts package. Django user Accounts can also be integrated into non-Pinax projects.
