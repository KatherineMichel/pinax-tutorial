# Getting Started

In order to get a Pinax starter project up and running, you will need to know how to do a few things:

* Navigate a command line
* Create a virtualenv
* Install a Pinax starter project and its packages in the virtualnenv
* Run the website on a local server

Regardless of which Pinax starter project you might choose to use, this process is virtually the same for all of them.
