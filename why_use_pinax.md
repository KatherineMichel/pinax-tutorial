# Why Use Pinax?

## Code Reuse

Computers were created to help people save time. When developers write code that solves a problem, they often package and publish the code in a public package index so that other developers can reuse the code in their own projects. This saves other developers who have the same problem from having to repeat the same work. In the Python and Django communities, developers publish their packages to [The Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org). 

## Pinax Packages

It can take a lot of time and work to create a website from scratch. The code for a typical Django project might be created for one website and used one time only. 

Pinax starter projects, apps, and themes work differently than typical Django projects and apps, because they began as regular Django projects, were developed to provide specific functionality, then packaged to reuse and share. 

The Pinax starter project is a Django project framework that can be installed using the Pinax CLI (Command Line Tool). The stand-alone Pinax apps that come pre-installed as packages provide the functionality needed for the project.

For more information about Django and code reusability, see the Django docs [Reusability Matters section](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/reusable-apps/#reusability-matters).
